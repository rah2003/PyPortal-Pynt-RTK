# PyPortal-Pynt-RTK — Single-Board RTK Field Device

Third build in the RTK series, following the Metro ESP32-S3 build
([`rah2003/SWMaps-propertylines`](https://github.com/rah2003/SWMaps-propertylines),
branch `claude/esp32-rtk-bridge-firmware-yokgan`) and the interim two-MCU
RTK-Feather build (local, `C:\Projects\RTK-Feather`). This build collapses
everything onto one board: an Adafruit PyPortal Pynt drives the ArduSimple
simpleRTK2B Lite (u-blox ZED-F9P) over **F9P UART1**, keeping **UART2 free
for a future plug-in radio**.

## Hardware

| Role | Part |
|---|---|
| MCU + display | Adafruit PyPortal Pynt (#4465) — ATSAMD51J20 @ 120 MHz, 2.4" 320×240 ILI9341 TFT (8-bit parallel), resistive touch, microSD, 8 MB QSPI flash |
| WiFi | ESP32 AirLift co-processor (NINA-W102) on the Pynt, driven over SPI (WiFiNINA) |
| GNSS | ArduSimple simpleRTK2B Lite (u-blox ZED-F9P), UART1 via Pixhawk JST-GH — **moved over from the RTK-Feather rig** |
| Antenna | Calian/Tallysman HC977 helical (33-HC977-35, 35 dB LNA), triple-band + L-band, 3.3 V bias ~21 mA, no ground plane needed |
| Storage | PNY Elite 32 GB microSDHC UHS-I U1 (in the Pynt's slot) |
| Phone | iPhone + SW Maps over **WiFi TCP** (NMEA server on the hotspot network) |

## Hard constraints (inherited + new)

1. **F9P UART2 / XBee socket is reserved** for a future plug-in radio. No
   firmware function may depend on it. (Base mode may *configure* RTCM3
   output on UART2 — config only, no wiring.)
2. **F9P UART1 is the Pynt's working port** (RTCM3 in; NMEA + UBX out) via
   the Pynt's D3/D4 hardware UART. ⚠ **The Pynt's D3/D4 sockets are
   reportedly silkscreen-swapped** vs. the classic PyPortal — verify with a
   scope/loopback before trusting labels (see `docs/QUESTIONS.md`).
3. **The AirLift cannot run WiFi and BLE simultaneously.** WiFi/NTRIP wins;
   there is no BLE in this build. SW Maps connects over TCP instead.
4. **The ESP32 AirLift and the microSD share the main SPI bus.** NTRIP/TCP
   traffic and RAWX log writes contend — the logging pipeline must tolerate
   SPI stalls (two-stage buffering, ported from the Feather build).
5. **The Lite's USB is an FTDI bridge onto UART1.** Never attach the
   u-center adapter while the Pynt drives UART1 — one driver at a time.

## Architecture (single MCU, cooperative superloop or light RTOS-less tasks)

```

Module lineage (ported/adapted copies, per the Feather precedent — not
submodules): `ringbuf.h`, `ubx_extractor`, `ntrip_client`, `gnss_config`,
`settings`/serial-menu from RTK-Feather & Metro. The Feather's two-MCU
`status_link` protocol disappears entirely. New modules: TFT/touch UI
(Adafruit_ILI9341 in 8-bit-parallel mode + touch driver), WiFiNINA transport
for NTRIP, TCP NMEA server, SD logger on shared SPI.

## Decisions (2026-07-11)

- **Toolchain:** PlatformIO, Arduino C++ (Adafruit SAMD51 core) — maximizes
  reuse of the proven Metro/Feather modules.
- **v1 scope:** Rover **and** Base mode, with RAWX `.ubx` logging to the
  Pynt's own microSD.
- **Phone link:** SW Maps via WiFi TCP; no BLE ever on this hardware.
- **Touch UI:** status pages (fix quality, correction age, NTRIP state,
  logging, sats/SNR) + touch controls (log start/stop, rover/base switch,
  safe shutdown). Credentials/config via USB serial menu — no on-screen
  keyboard in v1. **Portrait orientation (240×320)** — enclosure comes
  after the electronics and will be built around portrait mounting.
- **Repo:** public GitHub, `PyPortal-Pynt-RTK`. Secrets via gitignored
  `secrets.h` (`secrets.example.h` committed), same as Feather.
- **Inherited defaults (from Metro via Feather):** caster
  `acorn-gnss.net:2101`, mounts `VRS_SouthCentral_RTCM3`/`MS_RTCM3`, WiFi
  via iPhone personal hotspot, elevation mask 12°, constellations
  GPS+GLO+GAL+BDS (SBAS/QZSS off), F9P UART1 @ 115200.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 0 — Hardware verification pack** (`docs/hardware/`): wiring
      diagram (Pixhawk JST pinout → D3/D4, incl. the label-swap check),
      power tree (single-bank vs two-feed; decision pending measurements
      P1–P4), u-center re-verification checklist, bring-up checklists,
      platform/SPI-contention analysis — **verify wiring against these
      documents and current vendor docs before powering anything**.
- [~] **Phase 1 — Bring-up sketches**: written and **compiling clean**
      (PlatformIO 6.1.19, 2026-07-11: RAM 2.3 % / flash 4.6 %) — serial
      test menu covering TFT + portrait rotations, touch raw dump, AirLift
      version/scan/join + TCP echo (the SW Maps path), SD 4 MB write with
      latency histogram, D3/D4 UART loopback + TX-socket identify (the
      label-swap tests), live NMEA echo, free-RAM report. **Not yet run on
      real hardware** — that's the bench pass in
      `docs/hardware/checklists.md`.
- [~] **Phase 2 — Rover firmware**: written and **compiling clean**
      (2026-07-11: RAM 9.7 % / flash 10.3 %, `pynt-rover` env). NTRIP
      state machine (ported Metro→Feather→here, polled instead of tasked)
      → RTCM3 → F9P UART1; GNSS config via SparkFun v3 VALSET; RAWX/SFRBX
      → SparkFun file buffer → time-named `.ubx` on SD (one bounded
      512 B write per loop pass, pre-allocated contiguous files, 8 s
      sync); portrait touch UI (fix-state header, POS/SYS pages, LOG /
      PAGE / PWR buttons with two-tap shutdown confirm); SW Maps TCP NMEA
      server on :10110; SD `/config.txt` settings + serial menu.
      **Not yet run on real hardware.** Known bench items are flagged in
      code comments: touch calibration constants (from the 'p' test),
      WiFiNINA `server.available()` client-accept semantics, and the
      bounded WiFi.begin() stall (SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE=4096 rides it out).
- [~] **Phase 3 — Base mode**: written and **compiling clean** (2026-07-11:
      RAM 9.7 % / flash 11.1 %). Survey-in (dur/acc from settings) or
      fixed-LLH TMODE; RTCM3 out **configured on UART2 only** (MSM4 set
      1005/1074/1084/1094/1124/1230 — config only, the XBee socket stays
      empty and UART2 baud is left for the future radio to decide);
      NAV-SVIN progress in the header + SVIN line; `b_` log prefix; live
      rover/base switch via serial menu (`mode=base`). **Not yet run on
      real hardware.**
- [ ] **Phase 4 — Polish**: on-screen config keyboard, logging analytics,
      light-sensor auto-dim, speaker fix/loss chime.
